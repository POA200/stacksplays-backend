ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

Built a scalable backend API to power StacksPlays, a decentralized gaming platform on the Stacks blockchain. The backend manages game scheduling, user authentication, leaderboards, and admin tools for real-time casino-style and mini-game experiences.

ðŸ”¹ Key Responsibilities

Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints with Express.js and TypeScript.

Structured backend with modular services, routes, and middleware for maintainability.

Integrated JWT authentication and custom middleware for admin-only features.

Developed game scheduling system:

Allows admins to set game start/end times.

Provides universal countdown timers to frontend clients.


Created leaderboard service for tracking player scores and rankings.

Configured CORS & Helmet for security hardening and safe cross-origin requests.

Managed environment variables with dotenv and ensured sensitive data (.env) is excluded via .gitignore.
